# Static Page Template With Gulp

Setup information.
------------------

* run this to get gulp and it's plugin's (you'll need nodejs and npm installed)
> $ npm install

* add this line to ./git/info/exclude file to keep the node modules out of repository 
> /node_modules/*

* run gulp default task by running
> $ gulp

* compile sass by running
> $ gulp sass

* bundle js files by running
> $ gulp concatJS

The default task will automatically watch html, scss and js files,
compile them and refresh the browser on changes.
You don't really need to run the "sass" or "concatJS" tasks unless
you altered the source files without gulp running or pulled new
files.
